# Electron React App
A modified version of [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) which adds support for a Desktop App that also creates a webserver that serves the same content while being production ready.  

## Configuration
The config for the port of the webserver can be changed in `src/main/main.ts`.  
It will generate a `config.json` file at the same path of the built executable which you can modify.
